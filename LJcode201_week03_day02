I was still really not feeling well. Today was ok, but I learned some important lessons in coding in general.

I really enjoyed the CSS guest lecture with Brian. Thank god for the CSS god. This will save me so much CSS pain in the butt in the future. And CSS finally made much more logical sense.

I thought I was where I needed to be but I the parts I needed (alert when click other than image, button to show results after 25 clicks) took longer than I realized, also due to being pretty sick still. 

When Sam came over, I learned my essential lesson: when you are little to no use to yourself, go home. Working at the capacity I was at yesterday was only going to set me back. 

I decided to rest and tackle it in the morning. My CSS I had set up is not showing anymore, but I can fix that later.
