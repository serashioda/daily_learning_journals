Week 02 Day 04

Today was a breather day. I missed the 1st hour of lecture, which was Code Review covering Britt's awesome work. I will review that via video over the weekend!

Althought I slept "enough" (appx. 8 hours) considering I did not sleep much the last few days (yes, it's Week 2!), my brain just fought me every step of the way to finalize the Salmon Cookie project, whether it was fixing my JS (which worked fine yesterday pre-lab, but broke after adding in the form/fields), or beautifying my store/sales pages (CSS). 

I finally was able to work through some roadblocks of my new JS, and got it to partially work by EOD, thanks Annaka!

And, I was able to make it all work this evening. Yay! Now, the CS... I am exhausted so I am tackling that and finishing what I can tomorow bright and early. Good night!
