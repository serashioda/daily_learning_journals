Day 4

Today was awesome! I learned a lot.

Code review was helpful- Lee did a great job. Learning from others' approach, style, correct code, and errors is a great way to learn!

We also dove more into CSS. The problem with fixed-position was interesting, esp. in regards to smartphones and issues that arise in ios apps.

Where I learned the most today was during lab- Pair Programming. The lab itself wasn't one of the most challenging, but I ran into a situation that forced me (and my partner) to be challenged. And this is where I learned the most. Since this is really where I got the most out of class, I am directly quoting from my lab comment section:

     " Started slowly with the initial: How To Get Code Ready For Work, part.
      
      I began as the driver. We started small, and worked our way out to make a "mother" function that included 3 "child" functions with all of Adrian's games. Besides a small writer's block at the beginning, this went smoothly.
      
      Then, I was a navigator. We thought it was going to be easy, we were wrong. When we tried to apply the same method to my JS, because I already had functions in my code, it took us for quite the ride.
      
      Munir helped us with what was breaking my code, and taught us how to put a function within a function, when previous functions (with a different style) already existed. Because of this, we had to fix those pre-existing functions in a way that applied to the new method.
      
      We learn so much. We were forced to really think about what was in the global scope vs. local, why the code was breaking, and why were getting the errors in the console.
      [For example, on one of the pre-existing functions, once we put a mother function over the child a functions, there was no parameter to run and apply the method(.toLowerCase) to.]
      
      From Adrian, I learned a lot more about git command and terminal.
      Together, between Adrian, Munir and I, we learned the rest.
      
      The difficulty was realizing that each lab is structured with specific instructions (Day 1 and Day 2 leading up to Day 3 of About_me) for a good reason, and the effect of each part on the project in its entirety. 
      
      But I can't lie, I am glad I did what I did (the hard way that is), because I know Adrian and I both learned a lot. And, we know Munir had fun, too!
      
      Anything else? Brain freeze --> decompress, please. Thanks!"
