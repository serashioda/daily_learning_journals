Week 4 Day 1

Project Week! aaahhh! yeahhh! which is it? Both.

We have a great team. We planned maticulously, but as with all first time projects, it doesn't go as planned. We had a hard time breaking through our original wall, and though we knew it was going to be a challenge and that this type of game will involve many obstacles to overcome, we took it on. Don't get me wrong, I am glad we did. The important thing is to stay focused, and stick with our plan to start small, perfect the foundation, then add more content, stretch goals, etc. 

I think that we had such a hard time breaking through that initial wall, that we were itching to dive in (trigger-code-happy) and not think small --> big, and the strategic order there to prevent future disaster. We need to build the engine (ie. the core game.js) well and so it is condensed and efficient, and go from there. Luckily, we have great team members that are open-minded and communicate well, so I think we will be fine, so long we continue to communicate and work hard! Go team!!
