Week 3 Day 4

Today we found out who our Final Project teammates are. We have a great team with Adrian, Lee, and Taiwan. 

We had another CSS Fun with Brian (Part 3). As always, it was super helpful and made things really make sense.

Aaron also gave a lecture on JavaScript, and went over a concept that was the most mystery to our class- prototypes. He really broke it down in a hierarchical manner, and it finally made sense.

Lab was fun but very important. Althought it was more "relaxed" than on other lab days during Week 2, everyone in our group really focused and worked hard for part 1 of lab (which wasn't even an essential part, but we got what we were supposed to out of it). We also worked hard and continued to be organized, methodical (write out all the steps), and communicate to ensure that we 1) accomplished all the steps accurately, and 2) followed the intentional merge conflicts so we learned the lesson well before things really count and we don't want to deal with them.

Our group stayed longer and already decided on a game for our Final Project. We even narrowed down on the category, and specific topic and name. We decided that we are going to make full use of our man-power (we are the only group of 4), and take on a heavier work-load. We can do it!
