Day 3

Today was a BIG day.
 
I made my brain hurt. I spent way too much time on Q6, trying to make a NaN guess prompt have infinite tries (and if moved onto an actual # guess, havig that NaN guess count as 1 attempt, and having 3 more left with #'s).

I realized that I used 2 functions in my JS file of my About_me, even though the directions explicitly say to not do so.

Oops.

I did things the hard way, and used functions which took forever for me to figure out to satisfy all the criteria, when I could have just settled for while loops.

Another oops.

Lession learned. Each lab is structured a certain way for a reason. Stretch goals are a good place/way to challenge yourself further without messing up/over-complicating things in the log-run. Notes to myself: <b>big picture</b?|>!
