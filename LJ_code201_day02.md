Day 2

I am more comfortable with Git. Got that down!

I am going to take from my CSS/HTML Ch. 13 reading comments, as this was a big part of my dag, and a cause of brain freeze. And, this is how I really felt:

  I sure put [a lot of CSS] to use on Day 3 whilst working on the About_Me project. I definitely felt like Peter Griffin for a bit there. I need more practice with the display, and need to try the visibility property. Things get pretty fancy on pg. 319/320 with border-images and box-shadows, but these are more advanced than what was covered in the tutorials, and I personally had time to tackle today during our lab. But please, let's practice.

JavaScript class and reading material was straightforward. 

Boy, is it something else to actually come up with and write the content/code yourself. First day of Coder Brain officially felt.
