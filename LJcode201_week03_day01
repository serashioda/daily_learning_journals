Today I was really sick.

It was like what happens after finals week where you can push through the week with determination and addrenaline, but soon after, your body crashes. I was receptable to people sick around me and I caught it so easily.

In terms of learning, everyone was kind of brain-dead and really depended on each other to get through writing out our original code for the BusMall project. It was hard, but I got it done minus the alert when a user clicked on other than an image and the showresults button after 25 clicks. This was comforting that I was not the only one that felt like I needed to lean on others. Overall, regardless of our condition, we got through today's lab together.
