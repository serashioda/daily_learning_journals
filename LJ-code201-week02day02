Week02 Day02

Another challenging but fulfilling day. 

Started with code review of Maelle's Salmon Cookie Code, which was helpful. It was good to see I was right there in logic and correctness. 

Most of the challenge occurred during lab, of course.

Unlike yesterday, I decided to take a walk outside and meditate prior to tacking. I think lack of a real break yesterday affected my mind space and focus, though I did ok.
Week 2 is inarguably hard, and breaks and rest should not be taken for granted.

Taking from lab comments again:
"Challenging! But yesterday to today made me appreciate the DOM process. Constructor Functions are awesome, and I need more practice with tables! I had fun redecorating the page (aka, Peter-Griffining the html/CSS). I had a chance to practice efficient commenting more."
