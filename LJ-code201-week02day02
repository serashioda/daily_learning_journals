Week02 day01

Another challenging but fulfilling day. 

Started with code review of Maelle's Salmon Cookie Code, which was helpful. It was good to see I was right there in logic and correctness. 

Most of the challenge occured during lab, of course.

Unlike yesterday, I decided to take a walk outside and meditate prior to tacking. I think lack of a real break yesterday affected my mind space an focus, though I did ok.
Week 2 if inarguably hard, and breaks and rest should not be taken for granted.

Taking from lab comments again:
