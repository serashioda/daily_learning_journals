Week 4 Day 3

Today we broke past the Monday funk and were eager to make headway in our project.

Although we met up on Sunday and thought we got over out Monday-funk on Sunday, we were all still in that fog. We had a really hard time breaking through that day. Today, Day 2, we were in the mode and feeling the pressure of the timeline, and although we maticulously organized our daily plans, what we had not outlined/broken down was assigning specific roles (which part/file everyone will be working on). Today, we broke into 2 groups of CSS and JS. Adrian and Tai worked together on CSS, while Lee and I worked on JS. Lee and I had whiteboarded an overview of the JS on Monday, we had not set a concrete plan prior to  jumping in to code. Although it Monday was rough, I think we both could have done a better job communicating.  

Hopefully tomorrow, we can have a better rhythim and get working on writing a game engine that is funtional and does not utilize alerts and prompts. Ultimately today, Lee got a lot of the game.js written in the alert/prompts form. I worked on adding to the 2nd half of the storyline/events and starting the score chart.js. Adrian and Tai made great headline in the overall look of the game, and every page has a consistent, clean color/style/positioning pattern.

We are all going to go home and are eager to make more headway on our project. Everyone is motivated. I believe in our team.
