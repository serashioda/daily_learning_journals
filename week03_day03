Week 3 Day 3

Today I started to get my mind back after much needed rest. I was able to figure out the chart and the small quircks to fix, and the lab was as always important, but it was a good change pace.

The function and history of local storage is interesting, and I am glad I have a better understanding of it and can apply it to our projects now.
