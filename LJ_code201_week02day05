Week 2 Day 5

Friday! After surviving the grueling part of the week, and the lab seemingly harmless (and due at 4:59pm), I thought I was going to have an early start to the weekend.

Working with Keith for the lab was fun, we divided up the tasks and communicated well. When I finished with my part, we worked to finalize the CSS layout aspect together. It was unclear to Keith and I if having seperate branches was required (and therefore 1) needing to go thorugh merges and 2) being careful to avoid a merge conflict). Being maticulous in the git process seemed to be the bigger learning aspect for the lab, but it was also unclear to me what exactly could cause a Merge Conflict. Keith and I decided to avoid having seperate files and pushing our individual components after talking to Sam and Munir, and due to time constraints. I think we would like some clarification on what could cause a merge confilict (even if we were working on different parts).

The good news- we survived Week Two! Go us. :) I learned a lot this week. Thank you!
