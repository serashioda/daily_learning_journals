Week 2 Day 3

Today I went back to the collaboration process. I was reminded of why it is so efficient and works. By collab, I mean not just working with the person next to you time to time, but actually talking it out, working it out visually together.

We had so many different brains and strength working together, so I learned a lot.

Sam came over at the end to help Lee and I throught the stretch goal. We had so much fun there, too! I will add that in later.
