First official day with the group for final project.

We have a great group/dynamic. We made great headway in the organization and the storyline of our game, and set realistic goals in how many events/obstacles we would have in our Choose-Your-Own-Adventure game. Our game is called "First Day of Skeewl". We talked it over with Sam, Munir and Aaron, and including the possible challenges in choosing this type of game- how we would be limited to so many events, obstacles, and also content heavy. We decided to stick to this and take on the heavier workload; we were glad that we thought ahead and are realistic about how to structure our game, and what to put in our stretch goals. 

We finished outlining the organization of our project by writing out our Project Domain Overview, DOM model, and Scope, including MVP, Stretch Goals, and other random ideas that we maybe can go back to and expand on later.

Overall, sucessful first day, and and got done at a reasonable time without being trigger happy (ie. starting to code).
