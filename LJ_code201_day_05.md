<h1>Day 5</h1>

I learned a lot about the importance of following instructions to extreme detail. Although forewarned, I was not worried as I am very detail-oriented. Detail-orientedness is one of the first descriptors that those who know me well will use to describe me.  I struggled unnecessary in the lab, due to very minor erros that snowballed during the git/branching process. The small push-back during practice of this during lecture led me to try to rush to catch up, which led to some of the tiny but significant mistakes that eventually lead to a Merge Conflict. It was Friday, and after the first week of "Boot Camp", I was naturally tired. Tiny details is a slippery-slope and the difference between a smooth ride to completion or a hair-pulling-frustration. Details, details, details. I learned that lesson, alright.

I am going to quote my comments from the lab since I took some time to think and write it out:

    "The hardest part of my day was definitely the lab. I started by getting in a pinch with the Git process of the assignment, somehow it took me longer to access the raw data necessary to create the new repo, and when going over the new process in lecture (of creating new branches then merging). I just got a bit behind where I could not follow via terminal.
    
    I noted the steps, and thought this would be simple with notes available, but due to not going through the actual process, I forgot to go through the whole branch process for prob2, and did not finalize the process for prob3 by push--> pull request--> then merging.  
    
    Somehow I managed to create a Merge Conflict at the end due to this, and although the JS portion was and is what really intrigues me, I just had one frustrating roadblock to another. This honestly surprised me, as I am known to be extremely detail-oriented, especially when I have the time to properly review, and am meticulous about the details, which should have set me up for success of this assignment. However, because of what's been explained, it instead became a bit of a mess.
    
    Once I get to step away, decompress and take time to review GitHub and let the process/logic sink in, I should be very good at this type of work and understand it in a conceptual sense in the broader scope. Tripped over myself a bit, but review and learn, and I shall prevail! :)"
